## Abstract

In today’s fast-paced and digital-centric world, having access to your finances and money in the digital space has become more important than ever. Part of that digital evolution has seen many institutions developing digital solutions for their banking applications, but unfortunately, this has been done with varying degrees of success. As a personal example, my own banking institution recently released not only an entirely new mobile banking application, but a whole new rebranding of their credit union. Unfortunately, this release did not go smoothly as it probably should have, with my parents ending up the victims of banking fraud due to security issues in their application that were encountered upon the new application’s rollout.

That is why I seek to launch Prospera. While there is little innovation that really needs to come to the banking world, the way that money is digitally managed still has space for growth. The focus of this project is to develop a digital banking application that can be used both on web and mobile that is secure, optimized, and user intuitive.

## Features

Prospera is a banking application that primarily uses Google's Firebase as its project foundation. It also uses Firestore as the database, allowing for data access beyond the localhost of the development PC. As a C.R.U.D application, there are features to create data, read data, update data, and delete data. A member's data is stored across several different tables for additional security. All are accessed with linked IDs, either the user's member number or the account number.

• Account creation: New members can sign up for an account with Prospera, with only one user
allowed per email address.

• Profile control: Members will be able to update profile information such as first and last name, email address, and account password.

• Account views: Members will be able to view their current balances, as well as detailed
information on all banking transactions

• Transfers: Members will be able to transfer money from one account to another inside of their
application, as well as to other members so long as they have the other member’s account and
member ID.

• New savings accounts: Member accounts will come standard with one checking account and
one savings account, with the option to open a maximum of two other savings accounts should
they be needed to segment money.

• Close bank accounts: After an authentication method has been verified, members will be able
to close their additional savings accounts.

• Delete user account: Members will also be able to close their entire member account with
Prospera after authentication.
