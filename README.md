## Abstract

In today’s fast-paced and digital-centric world, having access to your finances and money in the digital space has become more important than ever. Part of that digital evolution has seen many institutions developing digital solutions for their banking applications, but unfortunately, this has been done with varying degrees of success. As a personal example, my own banking institution recently released not only an entirely new mobile banking application, but a whole new rebranding of their credit union. Unfortunately, this release did not go smoothly as it probably should have, with my parents ending up the victims of banking fraud due to security issues in their application that were encountered upon the new application’s rollout.

That is why I seek to launch Prospera. While there is little innovation that really needs to come to the banking world, the way that money is digitally managed still has space for growth. The focus of this project is to develop a digital banking application that can be used both on web and mobile that is secure, optimized, and user intuitive.
